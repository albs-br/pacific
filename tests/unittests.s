The unit_tests.inc file provides macros in sjasmplus syntax.

For other assemblers you most probably need an .inc file in a different format. Here is a [unit_tests_savannah.inc]](unit_tests_savannah.inc) in a format that e.g. Savannah's z80asm would understand. Maybe this can be used for other assemblers as well.

;include "unit_tests.inc"
